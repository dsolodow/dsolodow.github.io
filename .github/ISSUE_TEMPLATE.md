Thanks for requesting a new topic! :thumbsup:

Please do keep in mind though this is a *request*, not a guarantee. :wink:

I **do** get notified on **all** requests, and will respond to them. If it's something I know enough about to speak/write intelligently and usefully, and it's a suitable topic for this space (aka related to IT/tech and appropriate for a public space), I'll see what I can put together.

If I don't know anything useful/meaningful about the topic, I'll try to point you to a suitable reference.
