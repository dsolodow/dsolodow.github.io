# Why I love VSCode (and you might too)

## What is VSCode?

Visual Studio Code (VSCode for short) is:

From [VSCode Docs:][docs-link]
>...a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).

It's a powerful text/code editor from Microsoft that's:

1. [Free](https://code.visualstudio.com/license)
2. [Open Source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)
3. [Cross platform](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements)
4. [Extensible](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs#top-extensions)
5. [Customizable](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_customization)
6. [Regularly updated](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) (more so if you use the [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders) track)

## Why I switched

When VSCode first came out (announced in April 2015), I didn't pay too much attention. For one, it was a preview; (1.0 was released in April 2016), two it was focused more on web development (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.), three I'd been using Notepad++ for years and it met my needs.

What finally drove me over was the really slick [PowerShell extension][psext-link], and the news that going forward VSCode + PowerShell extension would be "preferred" (aka maintained) over the PowerShell ISE.

So with that, I downloaded a copy, grabbed a few extensions and started kicking the tires.

## Why I love it

* Built-in [version control][scm-link] (out of the box Git, extension for [VSTS][vstsext-link]) - helps good habits
* [Save as admin][uac-link] (new in 1.20) - if the file requires elevated rights to write, it will prompt you for UAC/sudo
* Extensions! - lots of ways to enhance/expand. Favorites so far:
    * [markdownlint][mdlintext-link] (warn about sloppy Markdown)
    * [PowerShell][psext-link] (code completion, linting, console, and more!)
    * [mssql][sqlext-link] (connect to MSSQL servers and write/run code)
    * [Visual Studio Team Services][vstsext-link] (source control for VSTS/TFS)
    * [XML Tools][xmlext-link] (properly format XML; includes turning long string into a tree)
* [Customizable][settings-link] - you can change almost anything; the settings are in JSON files that you can port around/backup easily.
* [Command Palette][palette-link] - instead of digging around in menus, just press F1 and type
* [Well documented][docs-link] - Microsoft (and the VSCode community) have put together a **lot** of documentation, howtos, getting started, etc. for VSCode.
* Side by side editors or previews - open two files side by side, or a file and preview (can we say Markdown or HTML?)

## Sounds nice, how can I get started?

Go [download][download-link] a copy for your OS, and install.

After that, Microsoft has several [Introductory Videos][introvids-link] to help you get off the ground.
If you're currently used to or experience with another editor and don't want your muscle memory to get in the way, VSCode has several [keymap extensions][keymap-link] available so you can use the same hotkeys/keyboard shortcuts for your current editor.
