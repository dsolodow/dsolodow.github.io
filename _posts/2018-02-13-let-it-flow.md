# Shameless self-promotion & automation

As mentioned in an earlier [post]({{site.url}}/its-alive), one of the problems with the previous site that I wanted to solve was a lack of traffic. So, in an effort to help that (and a chance to play with a new toy), I've setup an [IFTTT][ifttt-link] applet to fire off a Tweet whenever a new post hits.

This will be my first use of [IFTTT][ifttt-link]; in fact I just setup the account a few minutes ago. But it's about as simple as it gets for this sort of thing, and is tied to my Google account so NBD.

We'll find out if it works after this post gets committed. :sweat_smile:

Oh, and as a reward for your patience, please enjoy a Star Wars themed parody of *Let it go*:
