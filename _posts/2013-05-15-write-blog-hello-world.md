The blog equivalent of "Hello World"

Anyone who has ever read/looked at/skimmed a programming or scripting book has inevitably seen the "Hello World!" program. It doesn't do anything more than display that message, some at the console, some in a pop-up, and others put it on a web page.

It's intended as nothing more than a "look, you made a program/script that does something!". Then it lets you bask in your success before actually having you do something useful or productive.

That's basically what this post is; a simple "Hi, I exist!" before something with content.

Future posts will have content, but whether or not they are of interest or use will depend on you the reader. :)

If you're interested in seeing the various prototypical "Hello World" programs, Wikipedia has a nice list of them:Â [Hello World examples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hello_world_program_examples)
