# I'm leaving, on a jet-plane..
#### But I know when I'll back again...

So for the first time in my IT career, I'm making it to TechEd. This year it's down in New Orleans during the first week of June. 

Should be an interesting experience and looks rather like an IT related [GenCon](https://www.gencon.com/) (which I'm going to this year as well). I've got my schedule of events roughed out, and am planning my what to bring and what to leave list.

I've already told my co-workers that I'll be mostly offline during that period so if something catches fire, call 911. 

Any of you making it out there this year?
