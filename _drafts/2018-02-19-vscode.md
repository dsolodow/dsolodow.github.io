# Why I love VSCode (and you might too)

## What is VSCode?

Visual Studio Code (VSCode for short) is:

From [VSCode Docs:](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
>...a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).

It's a powerful text/code editor from Microsoft that's:

1. [Free](https://code.visualstudio.com/license)
2. [Open Source](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)
3. [Cross platform](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/requirements)
4. [Extensible](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs#top-extensions)
5. [Customizable](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_customization)
6. [Regularly updated](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) (more so if you use the [Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders) track)

## Why I switched

When VSCode first came out (announced in April 2015), I didn't pay too much attention. For one, it was a preview; (1.0 was released in April 2016), two it was focused more on web development (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.), three I'd been using Notepad++ for years and it met my needs.

What finally drove me over was the really slick PowerShell extension, and the news that going forward VSCode + PowerShell extension would be "preferred" (aka maintained) over the PowerShell ISE.

So with that, I downloaded a copy, grabbed a few extensions and started kicking the tires.

## Why I love it

* Built-in version control (out of the box Git, extension for VSTS) - helps good habits
* Save as admin (new in 1.20) - if the file requires elevated rights to write, it will prompt you for UAC/sudo
