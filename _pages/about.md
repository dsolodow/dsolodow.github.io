## Who am I (the author)?

## What is this place?

My little corner of the Internet, built on [Jekyll][jekyll-link] and [GitHub Pages][gpages-link].
The plan is for this site to be write-ups and/or articles around computers and IT related things.
There is a two-fold motivation here:

1. Oft times the best way to understand or cement an idea or concept is to explain it to others.
2. When I figure out something interesting, weird, or even just something that required pulling together various sources to turn into a final thing, I want to share it as a way of giving back. If something is already well documented elsewhere, I'm much more likely to reference it (perhaps with notes) rather than write up my own version.

## Why am I here (this website)?

Most likely you clicked on a link from somewhere (possibly [Twitter][twitter-link]). :smile:

In reality, it was probably for one of two reasons:

1. You know me (or at least of me) and came here to see what I'm rambling about.
2. You found a post via a search engine, and are looking at this page after reading what you came for.

Hopefully you found what you were looking for, and perhaps a few extra items of interest while you were here.

## What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?

Of course it's [42](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/yes-the-answer-to-the-universe-really-is-42-1351201.html)
