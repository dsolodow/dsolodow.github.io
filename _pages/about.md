## Who am I (the author)?

Hi, my name is Damien Solodow and I'm a Windows sysadmin.
I started with Windows Server back in the NT 4.0 days, and got my first MCSE on it back in 1999.
My first sysadmin job was in 2000, where I also got started with IIS 4.0, Exchange 5.5 and SQL Server 6.5; and I've worked with almost every version of them since.
I remember reading about PowerShell when it was still called Monad, but largely ignored it till I started looking at Exchange 2010, and then dove head-first down that rabbit hole.

My [modus operandi][modus-link] has been to find things that I (sometimes because **someone** has to) need to know about, find good resources on it and then read and tinker till I have something approaching a handle on it.
That started with the first PC (an AST 486) that my family got when I read the manual and then "DOS for Dummies", and continues today (currently ["Learn Azure in a Month of Lunches"][azuremol-link])

## What is this place?

My little corner of the Internet, built on [Jekyll][jekyll-link] and [GitHub Pages][gpages-link].
The plan is for this site to be write-ups and/or articles around computers and IT related things.
There is a two-fold motivation here:

1. Oft times the best way to understand or cement an idea or concept is to explain it to others.
2. When I figure out something interesting, weird, or even just something that required pulling together various sources to turn into a final thing, I want to share it as a way of giving back. If something is already well documented elsewhere, I'm much more likely to reference it (perhaps with notes) rather than write up my own version.

## Why am I here (this website)?

Most likely you clicked on a link from somewhere. :smile:

All joking aside, it was probably for one of two reasons:

1. You know me (or at least *of* me) and came here to see what I'm rambling about.
2. You found a post via a search engine, and are looking at this page after reading what you came for.

Hopefully you found what you were looking for, and perhaps a few extra items of interest while you were here.

## What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?

Of course it's [42](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/yes-the-answer-to-the-universe-really-is-42-1351201.html)
