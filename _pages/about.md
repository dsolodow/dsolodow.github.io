If @EndOfDay (Knowledge++) Then Day != Wasted

## Who am I (the author)?

## What is this place?

## Why am I here (this website)?

Most likely you clicked on a link from somewhere. :smile:

In reality, it was probably for one of two reasons:

1. You know me (or at least of me) and came here to see what I'm rambling about.
2. You found a post via a search engine, and are looking at this page after reading what you came for.

Hopefully you found what you were looking for, and perhaps a few extra items of interest while you were here.

## What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?

Of course it's [42](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/yes-the-answer-to-the-universe-really-is-42-1351201.html)
